## Feel free to use this if you like
This project can be used freely just feel free to create a copy of this application. 
Both projects are public so there are no issues. If you need some help with the setup freel free to reach out and I'd be happy to help. 

Have fun and remember, everyone gets nervous it's normal and we only grow from it. This was super fun building and I can't wait to dive into more projects that I'll continue to share.

The project also has tests with coverage and I tried for 100% but will settle for what we have now.
WCAG 2.2 AAA standard is set for the final result

Cheers and have an amazing time on your development journey.
